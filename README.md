# LeetBook
Your notebook for LeetCode.

## Features
LeetBook comes in two clients: Chrome Extension and Web. The Chrome Extension is meant for you to record your notes from LeetCode, while the Web Client is meant for you to review and manage the notes. <br>
LeetBook uses GitHub OAuth as its only authentication method.
